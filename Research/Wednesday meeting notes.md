# Wednesday meting notes

- We’ll bring trainees for World Enterprise 
- To get trained at our Mission Control Center
- Those trained in ASTRA can be known as Astranauts
- We don’t need the actual astranauts here in USA
- We need the Mission Control directors
- Who oversee the launches of droids and who guide the astranauts
- So… the entire training program needs to be around WE
- I mean…. 95% of everyone we hire needs to be Astranauts
- But 5% should be in ORBITAL Mission Control Command Center
- And then we can bring over H-3 Command Center trainees
- Let’s find a title for the trainees of the command center
- Reveltek - where we Revel in Technology by implementing ANDROID Ops ( a custom SDLC framework focusing on A.N.D.R.O.I.D. Advancement, Networking, Designing, Research, Optimizing, Implementation, and Delivery) here, our ASTRA-Nauts launch droids: apps, software, programs.
- Focus Hive - where our community agile managers keep the entire project moving along and keep everyone focused.
- SILK Hive - where we teach everyone the values of SILK (Society, Integrity, Love, Knowledge)
- TimmsiLand - a virtual training area where our ASTRA-Nauts receive training in ASTRA (Advanced Science, Technology, Reasoning, and Automation)
#####
Right now, things are running fairly smooth, though our community managers at Focus Hive don’t have technical literacy, therefore their project management skills aren’t as specialized as we’d prefer them to be.
Thus, we’d like you to refine the Focus Hive area or recommend a new area to train community managers who are also ASTRA-Nauts or at the very least have a passion for actually launching Androids![image (5)](https://github.com/Aini-Bashir/ASTRA/assets/117284277/95439a74-c5b2-4fda-8b41-e5aaa1421ad0)
