- Our plan is to have people do a preliminary training program online that’s fully remote and then if they do well then we will offer them the in person program in America. That is a two-year program.
- During the in person to your program, we will actually be placing them directly with clients to help incubate their companies and this will be very hands-on where they actually get to sit down with a CTO of a company and they get to watch firsthand so they will work with technical founders. They were work with CTO’s, and they will work on innovative start up out of Silicon Valley and they will go around actually sitting in board meetings helping to steer the entire budget and putting android ops into motion at an executive level
And I’d like to include his endorsement into our US paperwork
- I’d like him to say “there is no other program like this in Pakistan, and that’s why these students should go to USA to receive this training”
- We will have a very large online portion for it
- However, what I discussed with Aleem & Zaryab today requires in-person training
- We will provide basic training
- The program will start for children
- Little babies like Aleem
- All the way to teenagers
- Then to college kids And even for career advancement
- "reasoning" covers Psychology
- I mean.... we want to blend all of them together.  Psychology requires all aspects.  Psychology uses science, tech, reasoning, and automation
- We want to train people to be strong Psychologists in the year 2060, think of who a Psychologist is in 2060, They will have very advanced data on their client
- They will have a lot of AI they use, data points, intelligence profiles, etc.
and how it is interdisciplinary across the different sectors to include psychology, communications, business development, technical consulting, etc.
