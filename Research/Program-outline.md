# Master's Degree Program Research 
 
### Summary and Task Outline
**Goal:**
Develop a marketable name for a unique Master’s Degree program that integrates classical physics principles with leadership, organizational structure, and software lifecycle management. The program uses the Orbital Method and Android Ops framework to treat organizations and software as systems in orbit, emphasizing sustainability and resilience. The name should attract students from diverse fields such as computer science, physics, business, communications, and psychology.
**Key Points:**
- Program Content:
- Orbital Method: Treats organizations as bodies in orbit, applying classical physics principles.
- Android Ops Framework: Focuses on advancing, networking, designing, researching, optimizing, implementing, and delivering high-quality software.
- Quantum Leadership: Incorporates quantum concepts where spaces, people, and projects can have multiple uses; emphasizes creating culture through 'vibe checks'.
### 1. Initial Phase:
The program will start as an H-3 visa training program.
After 8 years, it aims to become an accredited Master's program at Hackney University.
- Target Audience:
Students from diverse academic backgrounds including computer science, physics, business, communications, and psychology.
Competing against traditional MBA programs and master's degrees in organizational psychology or computer science.
- Additional Context:
The program will be marketed globally.
Emphasis on sustainability and resilience in both organizational structures and software lifecycle management.
Partnerships with industry leaders (e.g., Microsoft Education Partner) to enhance credibility and appeal.
### 2. Tasks:
Research Existing Programs:
Identify existing master’s programs that integrate scientific principles with leadership and management.
Analyze their marketability to understand what makes them appealing.
Look into programs such as MBAs with a focus on technology or innovation.
Study Organizational Psychology master’s programs for insights into how they attract students interested in leadership dynamics.
### 3. Refine Keywords:
Ensure the name reflects the unique aspects of the program (e.g., orbital dynamics, classical physics).
Consider terms like "global," "universal," "leadership," "systems," "dynamics," "strategy," and "framework."
Emphasize the scientific basis without alienating potential students from non-scientific backgrounds.
Develop a Shortlist of Potential Names:
Use the following names as a starting point:
Master of Science in Leadership through Scientific Principles
Master of Science in Applied Physics for Strategic Leadership
Master of Science in Theoretical Foundations of Management
Master of Science in Physics-Informed Executive Strategy
Master of Science in Scientifically-Driven Leadership Models
Masters of Science in Global Leadership
Masters of Science in Leadership of Universal Dynamics
Masters of Science in Global Leadership Strategy
Masters of Science in Leadership of Universal Framework
### 4. Create Additional Suggestions:
Based on previous discussions and current preferences:
Master of Science in Universal Systems Dynamics
Master of Science in Global Orbit Management
Master of Science in Leadership for Universal Dynamics
Master of Science in Global Physics and Systems Strategy
Master of Science in Universal Organizational Principles
Master of Science in Global Dynamics and Leadership
Master of Science in Universal Management Sciences
Master of Science in Orbital Global Leadership
Master of Science in Universal Strategy and Systems
10.Master of Science in Global Systems Innovation
### 5. Evaluate Marketability:
Assess how each potential name aligns with the goals to attract a diverse student body.
Ensure the name is clear about the scientific approach while being appealing to students from various disciplines.
Conduct surveys or focus groups with potential students from target demographics (computer science, physics, business).
Analyze SEO trends to determine which keywords are most effective for online marketing.
### 6. Finalize Program Details for Accreditation Preparation
Ensure that all aspects align with future accreditation requirements by consulting educational standards set by relevant accrediting bodies.
Develop detailed course outlines that highlight how classical physics principles are applied within leadership contexts.
### 7. Final Recommendations
Provide a final shortlist with pros/cons for each name based on research findings & feedback from potential students/industry experts.
By following these tasks over the next month-long project timeline we aim to finalize compelling names for our Master's Degree Program that clearly convey its unique aspects while appealing broadly across multiple fields ensuring long-term success both initially under H-3 visa training transitioning eventually into accredited status at Hackney University.
